# Alec's Portfolio Website

This is a full-stack portfolio website with a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js installed

To start both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously, run:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will:

1. Start the API server on `http://localhost:5001`
2. Start the React app on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Automatically open `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser

## Other Commands

- `npm run dev` - Run only the backend server
- `cd client && npm start` - Run only the frontend server
- `npm run install-all` - Install dependencies for both root and client
